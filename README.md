# 🚀 My AI-Driven Data Analytics – 7 Day Excel Challenge

Hi there 👋  
This is my **AI-Driven Data Analytics 7-Day Challenge**, where I practiced key Excel and data analytics skills step-by-step.  
The goal was to clean, analyze, and understand data like a true analyst — using Excel as my main tool before moving into AI-driven analytics.

## 🗓️ **Day 1 – Dataset Selection & Import**

**Goal:** Explore and understand a raw dataset before analysis.

I started by importing my dataset into Excel and exploring:
- Row and column count  
- Data types (numeric, text, date)
- Missing or inconsistent values  

### 🧩 Dataset Options I Considered
1. [Superstore Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)  
2. [Netflix Titles Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)  
3. [Airbnb Listings Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/airbnb-property-data)  
4. [Iris Flower Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris)  
5. [Amazon Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lokeshparab/amazon-sales-dataset)

**My Observations:**
- Identified key variables like *Sales, Profit, and Category*  
- Detected a few missing cells in the “Discount” column  
- Found 10+ columns suitable for numeric analysis  

---

## 🧾 **Day 2 – Data Entry & Formatting**

**Goal:** Make the dataset professional and easy to read.

I practiced:
- Editing, inserting, and deleting rows/columns  
- Formatting headers (bold, color-coded, aligned center)  
- Freezing top rows for better navigation  
- Adjusting column widths for clarity  

✅ My sheet now looks cleaner and ready for analysis.

---

## ➕ **Day 3 – Basic Excel Formulas (Part 1)**

**Goal:** Learn to summarize data with core Excel formulas.

I used:
- `=SUM(range)`  
- `=AVERAGE(range)`  
- `=MIN(range)`  
- `=MAX(range)`  
- `=COUNT(range)`  

I built a **summary table** that shows:
- Total and average sales  
- Minimum and maximum profit values  
- Count of transactions  

---

## ⚙️ **Day 4 – Basic Excel Formulas (Part 2)**

**Goal:** Add logic to my data using conditional formulas.

I practiced:
- `=IF()` for conditional checks  
- `=SUMIF()`, `=COUNTIF()`, and `=AVERAGEIF()` for grouped insights  

**Example Conditions I Created:**
- Count of orders with sales above ₹10,000  
- Average profit for the “Technology” category  
- Total sales made in the “East” region  

---

## 🔤 **Day 5 – Text Functions Practice**

**Goal:** Clean and format text data for consistency.

I used:
- `=LEFT()`, `=RIGHT()`, `=MID()`  
- `=UPPER()`, `=LOWER()`, `=PROPER()`  

**Tasks Done:**
- Standardized city names and customer names  
- Converted all text into proper case  
- Extracted specific substrings like product codes  

---

## 🧹 **Day 6 – Data Validation & Cleaning**

**Goal:** Ensure my dataset is accurate and free of errors.

**Steps I took:**
- Added dropdown lists for categories using Data Validation  
- Removed duplicates with Excel’s built-in feature  
- Handled blank cells using:  
  `=IF(cell="", "Unknown", cell)`  
- Checked for consistency in category names  

✅ Result: A clean, consistent dataset ready for Power Query.

---

## ⚡ **Day 7 – Power Query Introduction (Optional)**

**Goal:** Automate cleaning and transformations.

Using **Power Query**, I:
- Loaded my dataset (`Data → Get & Transform`)  
- Removed nulls and duplicates  
- Replaced inconsistent entries (e.g., “East” vs “EAST”)  
- Re-loaded the cleaned data back into Excel  

Now my workflow is repeatable and automation-ready.

---

## 🏁 **Final Outcome**

At the end of this 7-day challenge, I achieved:
- A **fully cleaned, formatted dataset**
- A **summary table** with clear business insights
- Hands-on experience with **Excel formulas, text cleaning, and Power Query**
- Confidence to move into **AI-driven analytics tools** like Power BI and Python

---

## 💡 What’s Next?

I’ll continue this journey with:
- **Power BI Dashboard Challenge**
- **Python Data Analysis (Pandas + Matplotlib)**
- **Machine Learning Mini Projects**
